# 🧑🏻‍💻 Yohan Vergis Vinu

**`Machine Learning Research Engineer (LLMOps/MLOps/VLMs)`**

I'm a final-year Computer Science undergraduate at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. With hands-on experience from a research internship at Samsung R&D, where I led a computer vision project, and my current role at Moative focusing on applied AI and LLM-related tasks, I've developed a strong interest in multimodal (vision + language) and LLM-based applications. I aim to further this knowledge through a master's degree. Outside of academics, I'm passionate about fingerstyle guitar, tennis, and chess. I'm also a dog enthusiast and proud owner of a Rottweiler!
